Overview:
This project is about analyzing and visualizing COVID-19 vaccine WHO data with Power BI. The dataset contains precise information on immunization rates, demographics, and trends, allowing for a better understanding of worldwide vaccination progress. 
The primary purpose is to illustrate using Power BI to transform raw data into meaningful insights via interactive visualizations.
Dataset: 
COVID-19 Vaccination Data: The dataset contains a variety of vaccination-related parameters, including the number of doses provided, demographic information, and geographical distribution.

Excel: 
Data cleaning remove duplicates
PowerBi: 
Import and preprocess the data, including addressing missing values and using the Power Query Editor to ensure data consistency.
Create calculated columns and measurements to convert data into usable format.
Bar charts: Total number of vaccines administered by country and over quarter and year time with filter region.
Maps: Geographic distribution of vaccination coverage globally or by region.
Pie charts: Demographic breakdowns of vaccinated populations including region.
Tables: Provide extensive tabular data to gain more granular insights.
The dashboard uses interactive bar charts, maps, and pie charts to track and display critical parameters like total vaccines administered by country, demographic breakdowns, and trends over time. Users can use slicers and filters to drill down into specific data segments such as nation, date range, and vaccine dose type, allowing for tailored and detailed research.
